## Roadmap
    - [x] Add an initial .cpp 
    - [x] Create a user-defined function to cipher the text
    - [ ] Establish a complex structure for the program with the following: 
        - [ ] Ask the user to input string
        - [ ] File the given string 
        - [ ] provide the user the file attachment to store locally or something similar
        - [ ] when decoding prompt the user for a proper key
